				<p class="img-caption">Federica Brandizzi, professor of plant biology at Michigan State University and the MSU Plants Leader for the GLBRC, examines microscopic images (at right) of tiny but powerful organelles inside plant cells. The enzymes produced by these organelles can be harnessed for the sustainable production of biofuels.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Her extended family has been residing in Rome, Italy, for more generations than she can count; so when she left her hometown some 18 years ago to pursue an academic career abroad, that decision was very unusual indeed.</p>
			
			<p>But Brandizzi has not regretted it. At GLBRC, her research on the sugars found in plant cell walls is helping to develop a new pipeline for producing biofuel from cellulosic — or non-food — plant biomass. She was recently named an MSU Foundation Professor, a prestigious honored bestowed upon only a few faculty members.</p>
			
			<p>Brandizzi credits her successful research career to both her parents and her first botany professor at the University of Rome. As a child, her father, a Navy commander, and her mother, an archaeologist and author, instilled in her a desire to ask questions and be curious about the world around her. While gardening was never her passion, she did enjoy growing beans and measuring their leaf and stem sizes.</p>
			
			<p>Years later, watching her college botany professor draw intricate plant structures on the whiteboard got her hooked for life. “I was fascinated by the plasticity and potential of plant cells,” she recalls.</p>
			
			<p>That first professor remained her advisor until she graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Rome in 1997. A fellowship for a three-month stay in England then turned into a postdoctoral position at Oxford University, which became a springboard for her eventual move to North America.</p>
